## Description 

This is a fully functioning backend for a blog, it is part of my MERN project blog, buit with express js and mongoDB. The api endpoints allow for geting, posting deleting and updating posts, user endpoints allow for creating new users and authenticating on the website. Authenticated users can post as well as edit or delete their own posts.

## Main Learning Outcome

- creating api endpoints using express js
- the MVC model
- mongoDB schemas
- controllers
- JWT authentication
- storing images with multer
- validating requests
- password encryption using bcrypt

## Hosting

Hosting your own backend without using a third party service also requires a lot of setup, I used a VPS and set it up with nginx, which currently hosted at https://yungtest.site/posts
